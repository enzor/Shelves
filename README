== Shelves , a social library

Shelves is an experimental social webapp.
The users are divided in "Authors" and "Users"
Users can become fan of an author, make comments and rate books.
Author can do all of the above, and also publish their own books.

Shelves comes also with a ferret booksearch engine , and with an achievement system....why don't you take a try?

Soon there will be a copy online!
